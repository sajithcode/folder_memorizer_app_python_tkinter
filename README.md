- pip (Python package installer)

### Creating Windows Executable

1. **Install PyInstaller**:
   ```bash
   pip install pyinstaller
   ```

2. **Build the executable**:
   ```bash
   pyinstaller --windowed folder_memorizer.py
   ```

3. **Find your executable**:
   - Navigate to the `dist/folder_memorizer/` folder
   - The `folder_memorizer.exe` file is ready to use
   - Copy the entire `folder_memorizer` folder to distribute the application

### Alternative Build Options

```bash
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed folder_memorizer.py
```

```bash
pyinstaller --windowed --icon=your_icon.ico folder_memorizer.py
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Application won't start on other computers:**
- The built executable should work on Windows machines without Python installed
- If issues persist, try building with `--onefile` flag

**Antivirus software blocks the executable:**
- This is common with PyInstaller executables
- Add an exception in your antivirus software
- The application is safe and contains no malicious code

**Folders don't open:**
- Ensure the folder paths still exist on your system
- Check that you have permissions to access the folders

**Data not saving:**
- Ensure the application has write permissions in its directory
- Check if `folder_paths.json` is being created
